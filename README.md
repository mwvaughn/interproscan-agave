InterproScan for Agave

This is the Agave app bundle and description for a locally-hosted InterproScan. It uses TACC's Parametric Launcher to massively parallelize InterproScan analysis. 

The assets in these bundles are not by themselves sufficient to provide InterproScan - because it is a very large package (>50GB) it resides in a special directory on TACC's HPC systems. Setup and management of this directory is logged in the local/install-iprscan.sh file
